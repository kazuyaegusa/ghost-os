Your AI agent can write code, run tests, search files. But it can't click a button, send an email, or fill out a form. It lives inside a chat box.

Ghost OS changes that. One install, and any AI agent can see and operate every app on your Mac.

### What's New &nbsp; <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/v2.1.0-March%2010%2C%202025-brightgreen.svg" alt="v2.1.0">

4 new tools. 26 total. Ghost OS can now annotate, hover, long-press, and drag.

- **`ghost_annotate`** takes a screenshot with numbered labels on every interactive element. The agent sees `[1] Button "Send"`, `[2] Link "Inbox"` with exact click coordinates. No vision model needed.
- **`ghost_hover`** moves the cursor to trigger tooltips, CSS :hover effects, and dropdown menus without clicking.
- **`ghost_long_press`** presses and holds for context menus, Force Touch previews, and drag initiation.
- **`ghost_drag`** drags files between folders, adjusts sliders, reorders lists, selects text, resizes panes.

```
You:     "Send an email to sarah@company.com about the Q4 report"
Agent:   ghost_run recipe:"gmail-send" params:{recipient, subject, body}
         → Compose opens, fields fill, email sends. Done.
```

### Setup

### Recipes in Action
Send emails and download papers. Any app. Any workflow.

### Beyond the Browser
Slack messages, Finder folders — Ghost OS operates native macOS apps, not just browsers.

## Why Ghost OS?

Other computer-use tools take screenshots and guess what's on screen. Ghost OS reads the macOS accessibility tree — structured, labeled data about every element in every app. When the AX tree isn't enough (web apps, dynamic content), it falls back to a local vision model (ShowUI-2B) for visual grounding.

And when it figures out a workflow, it saves it. Other tools repeat the same expensive reasoning every time.

- **Self-learning** — A frontier model figures out the workflow once. A small model runs it forever.
- **Transparent** — Recipes are JSON. Read every step before running. No black box.
- **Native** — Accessibility tree first. Vision fallback when needed. Structured data over pixel guessing.
- **Any app** — Not just browsers. Slack, Finder, Messages — anything on your Mac.
- **Local** — Your data never leaves your machine.
- **Open** — MCP protocol. Works with Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, or any MCP client.

| | | Ghost OS | Anthropic Computer Use | OpenAI Operator | OpenClaw |
|:---:|------|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 👀 | **How it sees** | Accessibility tree + local VLM | Screenshots only | Screenshots only | Browser DOM |
| 🖥️ | **Native apps** | Any macOS app | Any (via pixels) | Browser only | Browser only |
| 🧠 | **Learns workflows** | JSON recipes | No | No | No |
| 🔒 | **Data stays local** | Yes | Depends on setup | No (cloud) | Yes |
| 📖 | **Open source** | MIT | No | No | MIT |

## Install

```bash
brew install ghostwright/ghost-os/ghost-os
ghost setup
```

That's it. `ghost setup` handles permissions, MCP configuration, recipe installation, and vision model setup.

<details>
<summary>macOS beta? Use the manual install instead.</summary>

Homebrew has a known issue on macOS developer betas where it demands an Xcode version that doesn't exist yet. If `brew install` fails, install directly:

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/ghostwright/ghost-os/releases/latest/download/ghost-os-2.1.0-macos-arm64.tar.gz | tar xz
sudo cp ghost /opt/homebrew/bin/
sudo cp ghost-vision /opt/homebrew/bin/
sudo mkdir -p /opt/homebrew/share/ghost-os
sudo cp GHOST-MCP.md /opt/homebrew/share/ghost-os/
sudo cp -r recipes /opt/homebrew/share/ghost-os/
sudo cp -r vision-sidecar /opt/homebrew/share/ghost-os/
ghost setup
```

</details>

## How It Works

Ghost OS connects to your AI agent through [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) and gives it 26 tools to see and operate your Mac. It reads the macOS accessibility tree for structured data about every app. For web apps where the AX tree falls short (Gmail, Slack), a local vision model (ShowUI-2B) finds elements visually. Click, type, hover, drag, scroll, press keys, manage windows. Any app, not just browsers.

```
You:     "Download the latest paper on chain-of-thought prompting from arXiv"
Agent:   ghost_run recipe:"arxiv-download" params:{query:"chain of thought prompting"}
         → Navigates to arXiv, searches, opens PDF, downloads to Desktop. Done.
```

Works with Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, or anything that speaks MCP.

## Recipes

When your agent figures out a workflow, it saves it as a recipe. A recipe is a JSON file with steps, parameters, and wait conditions. Transparent and auditable.

**A frontier model figures out the workflow once. A small model runs it forever.**

```bash
# One command sends an email
ghost_run recipe:"gmail-send" params:{"recipient":"hello@example.com","subject":"Hello","body":"World"}

# 7 steps, 30 seconds, 100% reliable
```

- Recipes are just JSON. Read every step before running.
- Share with your team. One person learns the workflow, everyone benefits.
- Chain recipes together. The agent knows when to call what.
- Write once with Claude or GPT-4. Run forever with Haiku.
